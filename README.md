<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


It is easier to crack password for english people because it is le langue of internet. And there is good resource as rockyou, hashorg2019, etc...

This project aim to provide french word list about everything a person could use as a base password.
If you are cracking with the list above, please also **use a rule in hashcat or john**.

I have already removed `Å“,Ã¯,Ã¶,Ã¤,Ã¼,Ã»,Ã´,Ã®,Ã¢,Ã«` which are difficult to type chars even if they are present in french alphabet.

### Downloads

[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/clem9669/wordlists?label=Release)](https://github.com/clem9669/wordlists/releases/)
![Github Repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/clem9669/wordlists?label=Repo%20Size)

Because It might be simpler for you, I already compiled 3 different versions of wordlists in the [Release](https://github.com/clem9669/wordlists/releases) section of Github

All details are there about wordlists combinations.

*Update*: The clem9669_wordlist_large &clem9669_wordlist_medium are too big for Github Actions. 
The current specs for Github Actions VM is 2-core CPU; 7 GB of RAM memory; 14 GB of SSD disk space.

### Web discovery

In the following [clem9669/weblist](https://github.com/clem9669/weblist), you can found a wordlist for pentesting purpose which is design to find resources for french people too.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

I let the end user use at their will the lists. 
You could use only certain or all lists depending on your scope.
See the release section in github for a uniq version compiled.

*N.B: I have recently heard of https://github.com/nil0x42/duplicut, it aims to uniq huge wordlist.*

```bash
$ duplicut wordlist.txt -o wordlist_uniq.txt
```

> **Warning**: the lists can be very big!
> Multipled with the rule at https://github.com/clem9669/hashcat-rule
